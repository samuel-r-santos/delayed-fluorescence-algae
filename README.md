# delayed-fluorescence-algae
Delayed fluorescence code R analysis from photon-counting multiplier tube.
The photon-couting experiments is performed with Raphidocelis cells in ecotoxicological tests. A photon-counting device is able to detect the delayed fluorescence behavior after light excitation during the Raphidocelis growth. Chemical concentration is also performed in order to detect the inhibition growth. All experiments are performed with a control test and chemical solutions.
